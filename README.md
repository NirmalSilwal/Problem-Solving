## Problem-Solving

:dart: I have prepared this repository during my coding ***interview preparation***. Basically I have implemented various logical problems in **Python**.

:gem: Various **Data Structures implementation along with the interview problem** associated with the topics are solved.

:pencil2: Filename is self explanatory for those directly wanting to jump over the interview problem.

:point_right: *Also you will find my solutions easy to understand due to standard naming convention.*

:gem: **CodingBlocks** folder has all the assignment and practice coursework while taking *Data Structure using Java* course.

:eyes: ***I will keep adding the challenging problems and their solutions on regualr basis.***  :smiley:
